He's just an all-around rude person. <br><br>To be fair, he hired females in the 70's to be high level directors. Trump critics can't fight against that. Plus, he insults and degrade men as well.<br>As for the racist portion, Trump is extremely against illegal and undocumented immigrants. To the democrats who advocate fairness and equality", how is it fair that the legal immigrants have to go through a stringent immigration process to get into the United States while illegals should get a easy, free path? If you really advocate equality, shouldn't you adhere to stricter border security while making legal immigration easier? While Trump's position is radical, he has a point. And remember, his wife is an immigrant. <br>So while I absolutely hate Trump's extremism, I congratulate him on winning over a cheater, killer, and shameless politician who undermines minority rights, Hillary Rodham Clinton."

Plus, he insults and degrade men as well.<br>As for the racist portion, Trump is extremely against illegal and undocumented immigrants. \nTo the democrats who advocate \fairness and equality\", how is it fair that the legal immigrants have to go through a stringent immigration process to get into the United States while illegals should get a easy, free path? If you really advocate equality, shouldn't you adhere to stricter border security while making legal immigration easier? While Trump's position is radical, he has a point. And remember, his wife is an immigrant. <br>So while I absolutely hate Trump's extremism, I congratulate him on winning over a cheater, killer, and shameless politician who undermines minority rights, Hillary Rodham Clinton."
